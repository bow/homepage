title: The Creature that Started Regeneration
---
Most (budding) scientists pick areas they think have the cool, interesting problems to work with. Of course people also do it for the improvement of mankind or the occasional financial gains. Still, one is rarely driven by those reasons alone. There's always the coolness factor involved. The late Richard Feynman said right, "Science is like sex, sometimes something useful comes out, but that is not the reason we are doing it."

One of that problem for me is regeneration: the ability to grow back lost body parts. 

I spent a better part of my previous year working on [a regenerating worm](http://www.macgenome.org), one the most interesting creatures I've known personally. Along the way, I've got acquainted with many different animals that posseses the ability and could not help but be fascinated by them. So I'd like to introduce them to you, starting from this post. My hope is that I can share the awe I felt when knew them the first time.

Allow me to begin by looking at how regeneration takes part in one of the most well-known mythology. 

Dating back from ancient Greece, there is [the myth about Hydra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra), the nine-headed beast raised by [Hera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera) herself with the task of slaying the half-God [Hercules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles). What made the creature fearsome, was its ability to grow two heads every time one is cut. It proved to be a big problem for the mighty Hercules, so much that he needed his human nephew's help to burn the beasts's neck stump after decapitation in order to defeat it. Later on, Hera decided to put the defeated beast in the sky and it became the Hydra constellation we see today. Regeneration really is the stuff of legends.

It's only apt then, that regeneration research also started with an animal called [Hydra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(genus)). The man who first began working on it was the Swiss naturalist Abraham Trembley, back in the 1700s.

In contrast to the mythological monster, the real world *Hydra* is a small, seemingly fragile animal. Measuring only a few milimeters, it spends its life in freshwater capturing food with its tentacles and reproducing itself by budding. It seems rather bland to look at first, but cut the animal into two pieces and you will witness its similarity with the mythical monster. From each of the cut pieces, a new animal will form. As if that's not amazing enough, one can also separate the cells forming the entire animal and see it clump back together to restore its original shape. In a way, the timid creature is more magnificent than the legendary beast. 

How does *Hydra* perform its remarkable feat? Let's look closer to the animal and see if we can find some clues.

*Hydra* is a simple animal. Its body can be divided into three distinguishable sections: the foot, the body column, and the head region. The foot is used to attach to surfaces, while the head is composed of a mouth and tentacles used for capturing its prey.

If you use a microscope to zoom in, you'll see that there are two cell layers making up the animal which are separated by a matrix called mesoglea: the outside layer, called ectoderm, and the inside layer, called endoderm.  Three cell lineages compose these layers: the endodermal lineage, ectodermal lineage, and the interstitial cell lineage whose location is mostly in between the ectodermal cells. Together, these cell lineages make up for the 20-25 different cell types found in the animal, depending on the species.

Two distinct layers can be clearly seen, along with several cell types. end: endodermal, ect: ectodermal, i: interstitial, m: mesoglea. Image taken from Bosch (2007) (see list of articles below).</figcaption>

What's awesome is that all these three lineages are stem cell lineages, capable of replenishing themselves and turning into other cell types that make up the entire *Hydra*. 

In fact, all cells that compose *Hydra* continously divide and change into different cell types. The endodermal and ectodermal lineages on average require about three days to divide, while the interstitial cells take approximately 18-30 hours. Under these conditions, one would expect the animal to be more than double its size every three days. In reality, it remains the same. This is because a portion of these duplicated cells are sloughed off from the head and foot region, while the rest is used to bud off a new animal from its own body. As I've hinted earlier, *Hydra* reproduces by budding its progeny off its body column.

The shape, on the other hand, is maintained by the continuous action of patterning molecules\*. These molecules direct cells to specific places in the body, giving form to the whole animal. More complex animals, such as chickens and mice, use similar molecules too, but not throughout their lives. Patterning molecules in those animals are only active during embryonic development. They cease to function when the adult form has taken shape. 

Broun and Bode published an [interesting experiment](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11861471) to see how continuously active patterning molecules influence *Hydra* development. They cut off the different portions of a *Hydra*'s head and transplanted them into another *Hydra* that has been labeled with fluorescent molecules. One of the cut off portion came from a small region at the ttip of the head called hypostome. When they transplanted the hypostome to the body of an labeled *Hydra*, it began to form a complete head and a body column. What's cool is that the new head and body column's cell all come from the labeled animal, showing that something in the hypostome is telling the host's cells to form a head. Even more interesting, they show that this new, growing *Hydra* could never form a foot. It's only capable of forming a head and body, hinting at the requirement of other patterning molecules to form the foot.

How do all of these connect to regeneration? 

I believe these two conditions, the presence of active stem cells and continous patterning, are at the core of *Hydra*'s remarkable regeneration ability. Whenever a body part is lost, *Hydra* already have the raw cellular material to replace it (the stem cell lineages) and the molecules that will tell these cells where to go and what to do (the active patterning molecules). In other organisms such as us humans, this is not the case. We don't have access to readily available populations of stem cells that can replace our entire body and our patterning molecules are only active when were still embryos. I presume *Hydra* is only one of the few animals that possess this characteristics. Other animals may include organisms that are evolutionarily close to *Hydra*, such as jelly fish (they do regenerate).

That being said, there is still much to discover about regeneration in *Hydra* and research is still on going. What we are after is the understanding of the exact molecular pathways that drive regeneration yet there are still many unknowns. What genes define the *Hydra* stem cells? How similar are they to our cells? How come *Hydra* cells continuously secrete patterning molecules but other animal cells don't? The list goes on. It will take decades (maybe centuries?) until we can finally say we understand *Hydra* regeneration completely. Until then, we can only wonder what goes on inside those small, simple creatures.

I will leave you now with links to other, more in-depth articles to read if you are interested. Next time we'll explore how another group of animals, the flatworms, regenerate.

Stay tuned.
