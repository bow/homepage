title: The Machine and Me
---
I love tinkering with computers. In my early days with the machine, in the Win95 era, I used to spend time trying out all menu items or modifying random files and see what that got me. Sometimes the goal was just to get a game to work, other times I just wanted to see what went on under the hood. 

Back then, personal computers were a prized posession of a family so my parents would get a little upset when my messing around rendered the computer useless. I also couldn't get to try out all the programs and games I wanted, because for some reason my father thought that games are incubators of computer viruses whose main purpose is to lower my grades. Not that I blame them, of course. I grew up in a period where home computing were developing rapidly, bringing new and strange technologies into our houses. Overcautiousness was an expected reaction. I made myself content with the limitations, and for a while it was ok. The computer already worked for the tasks I wanted to do anyway, so why bother?

It's only until I get my first laptop that things started to change.

At the core of it was my feeling of freedom. Finally, my own computer to tinker and play with! No one would complain if I uninstall that bloated antivirus program! No one could prevent me from installing that game I got from a friend! I get to partition the hard drives the way I like and no one would protest! 

Looking back, it was the beginning of a beautiful, intimate relationship. A computer started to become a way to express myself, rather than just a tool to get things done. In the beginning, it was just changing GUI and installing alternative applications. Little did I know, that that would lead me to become interested in different operating systems.

You probably could guess where this is going. Yes, my messing around with the way Windows looks has lead me to become a Linux user.

To be clear, I did not go into installing Linux at first because I was big on open source software of the free software movement. I just wanted to learn. You see, I had chosen to [study biotech for my undergraduate](http://atmajaya.ac.id/?f=8), and at one point I went to one interesting seminar from a [Korean scientist](http://jongbhak.com/index.php/Main_Page) at my University. 

He talked about bioinformatics in general, which fascinated me, because I didn't know that the combination of biology and computing is a burgeoning field. That lead me to ask him personally after the seminar, where I should start to learn if I want to go deeper in the field. His points were quite elaborate, but I remember coming home that day thinking, "I have to install [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) in my laptop." It was my own computer after all, so I had no problems of installing it and if I messed up, it would only be me who got affected.

That wasn't my first introduction to Linux, mind you. I had used it for a while in high school, but I couldn't see the point of using it back then. It felt clunky, weird, and the I was scared by the command line. But his talk gave me another purpose of using Linux: to learn. And so I did install Fedora and began my journey into the strange land of Linux.

Early on, it was still difficult. I bloated my Fedora, installing all sorts of software that I didn't know how to use, before finally rendering my computer unable to boot from it. It became easier, once I tried a friend's suggestion of installing a more newbie-friendly Linux distro: [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/). From then on, I started to use Linux more than Windows, becoming more comfortable with it each day and well-versed in the command line environment. 

What followed, as they say, is history. I switched from Linux Mint to [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), and from Ubuntu finally to [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/) just a couple of days ago. Along the way, I've fallen in love with the command line, gained a better grasp of the inner workings of a computer, and seen the importance of the open source software. On top of it, my computer had become more useful and I get to tinker with it in previously unexpected ways.

You see, learning Linux (and bioinformatics) have led to me learning more programming on my own as well. This was because most, if not all, tasks in Linux are performed in the command line and often you have to write programs to automate it. I still consider myself a newbie, but I can now start making the computer perform automated tasks using simple, small programs. Things like updating the software I use, organizing files and folders, have become easier to do because of these scripts. 

I managed to write a [small module](http://github.com/bow/abifpy) to help my regular analysis in the lab, as well. The code may be simple, but the feeling you get when you are using your own code is oh so awesome. It only makes me even happier when I could use this code base to [contribute to an open source software package](https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/master/CONTRIB) that I also use.

Again, this was not the first time I learn about programming (I had learned it in high school), but this was the first time I feel that programming isn't only something that's cool to do but also useful! It stops being just a series of interesting puzzles to solve, to become something that helps me personally. More important, is the fact that I can now start to understand the code that makes my computer works and change it to my liking, if I know enough about it. 

I haven't reached that step yet, but that's where I'm heading.
