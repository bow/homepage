The Author
==========

Until I manage to write a proper bio, I figure I'd put these quotes instead. Some of them describe me, the rest I find inspiring.

  <blockquote>
  Let the human mind loose. It must be loose. It will be loose. Superstition and dogmatism cannot confine it.
  <footer>[John Adams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams), in a letter to his son</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.
  <footer>[Albert Einstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
  <footer>[Arthur C. Clarke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke), one of his [three laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws)</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  The concept of an embryo is a staggering one, and forming an embryo is the hardest thing you will ever do. To become an embryo, you had to build yourself from a single cell. You had to respire before you had lungs, digest before you had a gut, build bones when you were pulpy, and form orderly arrays of neurons before you knew how to think.
  <footer>[Scott Gilbert](http://www.swarthmore.edu/x11800.xml), from the first chapter of [Developmental Biology](http://www.amazon.com/Developmental-Biology-Eighth-Scott-Gilbert/dp/087893250X)</footer>

  <blockquote>
  Selamat malam!
