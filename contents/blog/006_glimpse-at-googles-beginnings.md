On September 27th 2011, [the biggest search engine company on the planet](http://www.google.com/ncr) officially turned 13 years old.

A few days prior, I had just finished reading [I'm Feeling Lucky](http://www.amazon.com/Im-Feeling-Lucky-Confessions-Employee/dp/0547416997/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1317135886&sr=1-1), a book about Google's early days written by the company's former director of consumer marketing and brand management. I've been interested in the company's history since their products become an indispensable part of my digital life. How does a company nonexistent 13 years ago manage to turn itself into a verb synonymous with the internet? So when I heard an ex-Googler has published his accounts of working for the company, it did not take me long to pick it up from the book store and start reading.

Doug Edwards, the ex-employee, didn't seem like the stereotypical Googler. Instead of the young, genius techie coming out from the world's top University, he was a middle-aged father who could barely remember his GPA as an English major. He got hired by Google in November 1999 because of his marketing experience, and most importantly his ability to create low-cost marketing campaigns. One might expect that his background put him at odds with parts of the company's tech-driven culture. Indeed, this is a theme pervasive throughout the book. How he fits in the company, then, is also a theme pervasive throughout the book, making it feels more like a personal diary instead of a straight exposition.

In the book, he first takes readers to explore how several key personalities influence Google's early developments. His observations were derived from personal experiences and professional tasks, making most of them related one way or another to marketing. He also skirted around tech-related issues, though only as much as the lay people would understand.

The most influential and arguably most interesting personalities were those of the co-founders [Larry Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page) and [Sergey Brin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin). They were former Stanford PhD students who decided to make a company out of their PhD project, a search engine called BackRub. Their computer science background, Doug thinks, permeated the company's culture of being data-driven and meritocratic. It was also probably why Larry and Sergey seemed to possess a small disdain for disciplines that do not possess the binary clarity of computer science. This of course, kept Doug well on his toes, since his marketing world revolves around notions which is neither black nor white such as measuring brand effectiveness or constructing an ad campaign. He had to be able to respond to odd suggestions, like when Sergey suggested that Google scraped the entire marketing budget and use it to give free cholera vaccination to [Chechen refugees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechen_refugees) on the grounds that it would help people and make them love Google. 

The co-founders' dislike for doing standard business practice was another aspect of their eccentricity, which in hindsight could be the reason Google became the company we know today.

  <p>Absolutely not! We don't want to have anything to do with standards. We don't want anything 'standard'.</p>

I find several other interesting figures stood out as well. There was the Swiss computer scientist [Urs Hölzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urs_H%C3%B6lzle). If Larry and Sergey were the visionaries behind Google, Hölzle was the brains driving Google's engineering. Having joined Google before the company was ten-people strong, he has been credited for setting the engineering culture and hiring practices in Google. His policy on hiring people at least as smart as him must have been a key to Google's meteoric growth. Another person was the ever-resourceful [Salar Kamangar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_Kamangar), a Stanford biology graduate who has served various function inside Google from business development to product management. He was instrumental in developing Google's advertising platform and growing it to become one of the company's main revenue stream. Finally, there was [Marissa Mayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marissa_Mayer), Google's UI engineer who was also famous for being its first female employee. Her prominence in the book was partly because she is the closest thing readers have to an antagonist in the story, given her many professional disagreements with Doug. 

In the next sections of the book, Doug takes the readers to the business environment around Google's early days. One interesting point was Google's quest to find its identity. Readers will see how Google's April Fools tradition came about and how its "Don't Be Evil" motto came into existence. Doug himself was integral in shaping these two Google quirks. Readers will also glimpse Google's business deals, how it tried to maneuver itself to beat the dominant company then, [Inktomi](http://en.wikipedia.org/Inktomi) and another startup rival called [GoTo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto.com). Inktomi rented search technology to big sites at the time such as [AOL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL) and Microsoft's [MSN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN), while GoTo's business model was based on bidding for search placement results. Both companies would later be acquired by [Yahoo!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo). 

Along the business-related stories, user-centered issues such as privacy is also discussed. In general, I got the feeling that at least during Doug's time, Google cared about user privacy. Although, this concern seemed to be diluted as Google grows and trusts its user data with more and more people. The narrative turned more serious in the wake of [9/11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks), when Google wanted to check if it could track down the plane bombers based on their possible use of the search engine. They couldn't, as it turned out. Still, it makes one wonder what capabilities Google now has, if in 2001 it was already pondering for the possibilities of  tracking users. 

Finally, the book closes with Google successfully scoring big on its [IPO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPO) in August 2004, rewarding its early employees with huge financial boons. It officially marked Google's ending as a startup and its beginning as a corporate giant. Doug's era was also coming to an end, as his skillsets were quickly superseded by the hordes of new and brilliant hires. He argued he could have negotiated for a position, given his roles in the early days, but thought that was too much even for him. Google's IPO ended up rewarding him more money than he had in 30 years and he felt content. Not only that, it has allowed him to be part of history as Google now is still growing to be an integral part of our lives on the web. Accordingly, he ended the book with an advice for people still curious about Google: to look up more information using the website that has served him well many times, [google.com](http://www.google.com).

Overall, I find the book to be an enjoyable read. It's not for people who wish to know more about Google's technology, an obvious fact given Doug's role in the company. It does give a unique view about the key individuals and business ideas that has shaped the internet giant. Definitely recommended for those looking for fresh perspectives on Google.
